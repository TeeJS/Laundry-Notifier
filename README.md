![project image](https://github.com/TeeJS/Laundry-Notifier/blob/main/images/PXL_20251209_004040392.jpg)
a Home Assistant project to provide laundry notifications

ESPHome device that sets a laundry user that in conjunction with a power sensor on the washer and vibration sensor on the dryer sends out Discord messages when the laundry is done. 

##  Features
uses sensors to monitor the laundry machines (I use power for the washer and vibration for the drier).  Sets a "user" based on button presses and sends a @ mention to them - although I'm sure you could configure it to use your messaging platform of choice!
