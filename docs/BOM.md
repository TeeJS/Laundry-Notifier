1. ESP32 - I used a ESP-WROOM-32S because that's what I had on hand, but any one that has enough pins for the number of buttons you want to use should work ~$5
2. screen - you should be easily able to use any I2C screen - I used:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T6SJBV5  ~$3
3. buttons - any SPST momentary ones should work - I used these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752RMB7Q, mainly because they were the colors I wanted ~$2
4. sensors - I used a power plug to monitor the washer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPY5D1KC and vibration sensor for the dryer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG4KD97V ~ $25
5. cabling - any cables should work - I used a mini breadboard (from AliExpress but identical to https://www.amazon.com/Honbay-Colorful-Points-Solderless-Circuit/dp/B06XT1LL3H and breadboard wires (male to female) to make it easier to reconfigure in the future. I'd reccomend 8 or 10 CM wires. Heatshrink will help keep soldered joints tidy. ~$2
5. 3D printed case 

optional:
* SHT31-D or other sensor for temp & humidity - I used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5TN8LZB ~$4.25

total, as built: $41.25 - but I'm sure you can faid the parts cheaper on AliExpress!
