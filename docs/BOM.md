1. ESP32 - I used a ESP-WROOM-32S because that's what I had on hand, but any one that has enough pins for the number of buttons you want to use should work
2. screen - you should be easily able to use any I2C screen - I used:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T6SJBV5
3. buttons - any SPST momentary ones should work - I used these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752RMB7Q, mainly because they were the colors I wanted
4. cabling - any cables should work - I used a mini breadboard (from AliExpress but identical to https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0146MGBW and breadboard wires to make it easier to reconfigure in the future
5. 3D printed case 

optional:
* SHT31-D or other sensor for temp & humidity - I used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5TN8LZB
